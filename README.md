# MiniDataBase 
Data Storage and Retrieval using B+ Tree Indexing.

The database engine is designed on Relational model.

## QUERIES SUPPORTED BY SYSTEM
1. SHOW Tables
2. CREATE Tables
3. INSERT INTO Table
4. DISPLAY Table contents
5. SEARCH INTO Table
6. DROP Table


## SYSTEM DESIGN
The Database System is designed using C++ and C combined features.
It stores the data on physical disk using files.

Features of system include:

#### 1. Custom Blocks for each table:
The data is stored in blocks.  

Benefits of blocking: [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_(data_storage))

All the separate row data of a particular table is stored in different file creating blocks of data. System reads as well as writes data back to files in blocks.

#### 2. B+ Tree Indexing:
A separate multilevel B+ tree is created for each table. Each node contains maximum of 50 entries. Right now data storage  is based only on primary key, primary key can be INTEGER or VARCHAR.

#### 3. Storing Meta Data of Tables:
 Meta Data of the tables are stored separately which provides quick access to several information like current number of records, table name, etc.
 
#### 4. B+ Tree Indexed Search:
 For searching a record in file for particular table, B+ tree indexed search is implemented. Search is only based on primary  key right now.

System also calculates the time taken by the search algorithm.
 
## DEVELOPMENT:
The whole project is initially done on eclipse platform(C/C++ perspective).

Further modifications are done on linux

For execution: Open directory MiniDatabase(branch:master) and on terminal

1. Type **make**, it will compile the project.
	
2. Type **./tinydb** for running project.
	
3. Type **make clean** for recompiling the project.
